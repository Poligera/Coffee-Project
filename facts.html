        <h3>The word ‘coffee’ originated from ‘wine’.</h3>
        <p>
          The earliest word for the drink was the Arabic “qahwah”, which
          referred to a type of wine. Later on, the Ottoman Turks used the term
          “kahve”, which was followed by the Dutch word “koffie”, from which the
          English name was derived in 1582.

        <h3>People once tried to ban coffee.</h3>
        <p>
          Many different groups sought to ban coffee in its early years, both
          across the world and in the UK. These bans were often as a result of
          the stimulating effect of the drink or the crowd it attracted, as
          coffee houses often became places for free thinkers to discuss ideas.
          Nowadays, coffee is available almost everywhere in the world!

        <h3>Coffee beans are actually seeds.</h3>
        <p>
          The ‘coffee bean’ as we know it is the pit of a coffee cherry, the
          berries from which the process of delivering great coffee begins. They
          are called beans due to their shape and are technically seeds that
          will grow if planted in the right conditions.
